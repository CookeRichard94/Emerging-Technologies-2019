# Digit Reader
## 1. Intro
This project was developed as part of the Emerging Technologies module at GMIT, in the Computing in Software Development course, year 4, it involves using the MNIST dataset to train a neural network to recognise hand-written digits sent to the network via a web app that allows the user to draw the digits. The neural network or model, will be created in python using the Keras library in Jupyter Notebook. The web app has been created using a  standard HTML, Javascript and CSS configuration. The model and the web app are connected via a python Flask server file which will connect the two by sending data from the web app to the neural network in the notebook.
